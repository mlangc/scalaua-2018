# Spark ML Meets Real Estate

In this talk I will share my hands on experience with real estate adverts
classification using Spark ML. After a brief introduction into the problem
at hand, some basics from machine learning and the relevant Spark APIs,
I will present my solution, as well as the stony road that led me there.

Apart from discussing different algorithms, hyper parameter tuning and
feature selection, I will also talk about how to maintain
a corpus of manually labeled data to train and test your models.
